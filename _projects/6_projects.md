## <span style="color: #daa520;"> Design Process </span>

**Game concept:** 
Play as rival newscasters fighting to sabotage the others’ career! Hack the other’s teleprompter and force them to make sense of the gibberish on their screen, at the risk of fumbling their words in front of millions. Hijack, get humbled, and have fun!

**Core mechanics:**
Hack the enemy teleprompter and make your enemy fumble when it comes to their turn to deliver the news. A swapping mechanism of players 'hacking' then guessing. With 5 strikes, you're out and fired! 

I programmed in mechanics, along with my partners Cami & Dimtrios. 

**Art:**
