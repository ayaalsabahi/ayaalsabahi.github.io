## <span style="color: #54717a;">Motivation</span>
I absolutely love things where humans, technology, and emotion intersect, things like Detroit: Become Human and The Terminator.

I wanted to recreate a spinoff with all those combibed with my Omani culture and heritage. 

Grandmother can be called as 'Bibi', '7abo', or 'Ma' depending on the househod, I felt that combining Bibi + Borg (from cyborg) worked out best!

## <span style="color: #8a837d;">Scope and Outline</span>
I managed all aspects of this project and was responsible for all components of the animation, which is listed in the toolkit below.

Timeline was roughly 5 weeks.

## <span style="color: #3d5a80;">Technology Used</span>
- Maya (modelling, weight painting, rigging, retoplogization, UV mapping)
- Zbrush (initial sculpt)
- SubstancePainter (Texture painting & baking)
- Adobe Sketchbook + Photoshop (Initial Sketches)
