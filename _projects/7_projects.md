## <span style="color: #daa520;"> Design Process </span>

**Game concept:** 
A husband and wife dollmaker couple grieved by their loss boy make a doll trying to remake their son, except now he's trapped and is trying to escape with his toy mouse following you, and helping you solve puzzles!

**Core mechanics:**
Navigate a haunted house with a intro level, two puzzles and a final boss level. 

Some levels require you to to switch bodies to the mouse in order to solve the puzzles. 

I held a producer role for this project, used a Trello board ensuring that tasks are moving at a timely pace every week with a standup everyday. 

I also worked on sound design and integration, I also programmed in the intro level, second puzzle, and final boss level. 

My other teamates worked on UI, mechanics of how the boy and mouse move, first level, as well as integrating the art in after greyboxing.
