## <span style="color: #daa520;"> Design Process </span>

**Game concept:** "Finding Oberon", Oberon being the King of Faries in medival folklore. Wanted to incoorperate calming Lo-Fi music with a relaxing environment that allows you to step into a different world.

**Core mechanics:**
- 3D movement with 1st person perspective, clipped so that player does not turn 360 degrees
- Quest completion with 3 quests, with the subsequent only unlocking as well as UI and Assets (like cauldron) popping up if prerequisits are satsfied
- tells a story of finding a forest, gathering ingredients, cooking, then learning new calming tea recipies

**Art:**
- Warm color palette with pastel colors to give a cozy vibe and atmosphere 
- 'Sparkly' post production after effects to add a magical forest atmosphere 
- Library was created by a teammate, I 3D modelled the books and placed them in the library 

**Controls:** WASD/arrows + mouse 

**Platform:** Mac & Windows

## <span style="color: #3d5a80;">Technology Used</span>
- C#
- Unity
- Maya

## <span style="color: #54717a;">Motivation</span>
Like many other devs & artists, I had a bunch of half - done or almost done projects, with not many that were polished. I really wanted to create something that was from games I loved playing with it being a bit simplified that is open world, has multiple quests and a theme of repetition of ending things to reaching where they are at the end of the day. 

## <span style="color: #8a837d;">Scope and Outline</span>
We created this game for an itch.io 3 week game jam, I took care of the programming and game deisgn aspects, all the way from the placement of items on the map to the storyline and post-production effects.
