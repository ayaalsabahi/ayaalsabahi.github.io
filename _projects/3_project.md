## <span style="color: #54717a;">Motivation</span>
Like many other devs & artists, I had a bunch of half - done or almost done projects, with not many that were polished. I really wanted to create something that was from games I loved playing with it being a bit simplified that is open world, has multiple quests and a theme of repetition of ending things to reaching where they are at the end of the day. 

## <span style="color: #8a837d;">Scope and Outline</span>
We created this game for an itch.io 3 week game jam, I took care of the programming and game deisgn aspects, all the way from the placement of items on the map to the storyline and post-production effects.
