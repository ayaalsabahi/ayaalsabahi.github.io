## <span style="color: #54717a;">Motivation</span>
I struggled A LOT in my first semester in Univeristy, to the extent where I wanted to create something that helped me out as well as other freshman. 

I had a class in my first semester that kind of changed my outlook on the different types of Professors in CS and what they do (from theoretical, networks, logic, security, NLP and so much more!) as well as understanding the difference in time managment between high school and university. 

A lot of quotoes are inpired by things facualty sort of jokingly but also realistically meant, for eg: "YOU are the problem".

## <span style="color: #8a837d;">Scope and Outline</span>
This was my first ever full project, created within a 3 week timeline for my Introduction to Programming class. Challenges I faced were ensuring that I had enough features that any freshman would need. Next steps would be including integration with Google Calendar's API. 

## <span style="color: #3d5a80;">Technology Used</span>
Python3 + TKinter library
