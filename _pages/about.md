Hi, I'm Aya, a third year computer science student at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy Qatar with a minor in game design!

## Why CS? 
My interest in CS stems from attempting to undertand how computers work, and now I'm slightly better aquainted. 

I figured somehwere along the way the design aspec of this complex world interested me the most, whether its system level design, design in proofs, or even games. 

**Head to projects to look at my most recent work**

Reach out for collaberations or other points of interest...
