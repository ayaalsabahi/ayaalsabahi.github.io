Hi, I'm Aya, a second year computer science student at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy Qatar by day, artist by night. Here you'll find my occasional thoughts and feelings, who I am, but most importantly my projects and current academic interests.
 
My enjoyment currently lie in technology for social good and delving deeper into computer systems. 


Hope you'll enjoy your stay, reach out for collaberations or other points of interest! (ɔ◔‿◔)ɔ ♥

    We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.
