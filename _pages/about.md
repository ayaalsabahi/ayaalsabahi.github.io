Hello! I’m Aya, a Master’s student in Entertainment Technology at Carnegie Mellon University with a background in computer science.

My undergraduate studies in CS grew out of an early interest in games and a curiosity about how computers work. Over time, I realized my strongest passion lies in design—whether at the system level, in theoretical frameworks, or through interactive experiences.

At CMU, I’m exploring the intersection of design, technology, and storytelling, with the goal of creating engaging and meaningful experiences that bring together technical precision and creative vision.

**Head to projects to look at my most recent work**
