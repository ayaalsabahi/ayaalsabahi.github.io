Hi, I'm Aya, a third year computer science student at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy with a minor in game design!

## Why CS? 
My interest in CS stems from attempting to undertand how computers work, and now I'm slightly better aquainted. I thought I really enjoyed systems but as it turns out I'm more fascinated with the design aspect more than anything else. 

Reach out for collaberations or other points of interest! (ɔ◔‿◔)ɔ ♥
