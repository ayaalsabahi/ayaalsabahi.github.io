Hi, I'm Aya, a third year computer science student at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy with a minor in game design!

## Why CS? 
My interest in CS stems from attempting to undertand how computers work, and now I'm slightly better aquainted if I say so myself. 

## What is this website?
Head over to my projects section to check out my work, my artstation has all the behind the scenes artsy stuff.


Hope you'll enjoy your stay, reach out for collaberations or other points of interest! (ɔ◔‿◔)ɔ ♥
