I sometimes pretend I'm a really hardcore game critic.
**Mini disclaimer:** Maybe you should not trust a 20 year old who is just trying to figure things out, but I digress.

## <span style="color: #8a837d;">Movies</span>
- **21 Jumpstreet** - It plays on various different tropes that makes the whole thing a comical
- **Dead Poets Society** - The movie gives a sense of finding who you are, being genuine, and looking at the world differently.

## <span style="color: #3d5a80;">Shows</span>
- **Succession** - an absolute MASTERPIECE of a show, I think there is a fine line between comedy and tragedy. The show poses as a drama between a multibillion dollar family most can only dream of, but the show has the perfect ratio of dry humor to drama to make for a combination no other show was able to do before. Although a little slow at times I must admit, it is rather worth it. 
- **Silicon Valley** - I have to give it to this show to being one of the reasons I got into CS, younger high school me somewhat related to the characters, but also found the very nerdy jokes embedded (haha see what I did there?) quite funny.
- **Black Mirror Episodes** - White Bear

## <span style="color: #54717a;">Books & Comics</span>
Comics:
- V for Vendetta - ðŸ§ ðŸ’¥

Books:

## <span style="color: #54717a;">Games</span>
- **Spiderman PS4** - Okay Okay I know what you're saying, spiderman again, is that a... *bias*? NO. Hear me out. Insomniac studios have integrated game mechanics, storyline, and animations seamlessly. The mechanics of Spiderman 2 on PS5 and haptics are also pretty dope!
- **Detroit: Become Human** - There is some controversy surrounding the game in the sense that the gameplay is not too great, but I feel that if you think of it as an interactive movie, the fact that there are 30 different endings to a story you write and create plays out really nicely and is truly well written.
